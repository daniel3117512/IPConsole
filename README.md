IPConsole
=========

External IP Detection in a console app.

This is a simple console application to detect your external IP address.
Source code is available, improve it, edit it ...

I used a part of the SimpleIPDetector's code available here : https://github.com/daniel3117512/SimpleIPDetector

Enjoy !
